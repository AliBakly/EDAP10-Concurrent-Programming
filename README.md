# EDAP10-Concurrent-Programming
Lab solutions to LTH course in Concurrent Programming. Concurrent programs combine parallel, asynchronous activities, frequently interacting with a physical environment. 
Applications include control systems, network communication, and interactive systems. We gained the aability to design robust, efficient, and well-structured concurrent programs.
